# üöÄ Flutterwave Payment Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Flutterwave payment integration for your Django e-commerce project. **This project now uses Flutterwave exclusively for all payment processing.**

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Flutterwave Account**: Sign up at [Flutterwave Dashboard](https://dashboard.flutterwave.com/)
2. **Django Project**: Your e-commerce project should be running
3. **Domain**: A live domain for webhook URLs (or localhost for testing)

## üîë Step 1: Get Your Flutterwave API Keys

### 1.1 Create Flutterwave Account
- Go to [Flutterwave Dashboard](https://dashboard.flutterwave.com/)
- Sign up for a new account
- Complete your business verification

### 1.2 Get API Keys
- Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí API Keys** in your Flutterwave Dashboard
- Copy your **Public Key** (starts with `FLWPUBK_`)
- Copy your **Secret Key** (starts with `FLWSECK_`)
- Copy your **Encryption Key** (for additional security)

## üîß Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

### 2.1 Create/Update `.env` File
Add these variables to your `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Django Settings
SECRET_KEY=your-django-secret-key-here
DEBUG=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=webblog902@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=ercupdkazeiprbzc

# Flutterwave Configuration (REQUIRED)
FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY=FLWPUBK_TEST_your_actual_public_key_here
FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY=FLWSECK_TEST_your_actual_secret_key_here
FLUTTERWAVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_actual_encryption_key_here
FLUTTERWAVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
```

### 2.2 Replace Placeholder Values
- Replace `FLWPUBK_TEST_your_actual_public_key_here` with your actual public key
- Replace `FLWSECK_TEST_your_actual_secret_key_here` with your actual secret key
- Replace `your_actual_encryption_key_here` with your encryption key
- Replace `your_webhook_secret_here` with a secure webhook secret

## üåê Step 3: Set Up Webhooks

### 3.1 Configure Webhook URL
- Go to **Settings ‚Üí Webhooks** in your Flutterwave Dashboard
- Add a new webhook endpoint:
  - **URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/orders/webhook/flutterwave/`
  - **Events**: Select all payment events (charge.completed, charge.failed, etc.)

### 3.2 Test Webhook
- Use the webhook testing tool in Flutterwave Dashboard
- Verify that your Django app receives webhook notifications

## üß™ Step 4: Test the Integration

### 4.1 Run Setup Command
```bash
python manage.py setup_payments
```

### 4.2 Check Payment Methods
The command should show:
- ‚úÖ Flutterwave Card
